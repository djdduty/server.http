h2. Marrow HTTP/1.1 Server

A fast, multi-threaded, multi-process, optionally asynchronous HTTP/1.1-compatible WSGI 2 server.

* Based on Tornado's IOLoop/IOStream architecture.
* Not as fast as Tornado's web server, but understands WSGI natively while maintaining async support.
* Understands WSGI 2; something no other WSGI server does.  ;)

In the near future:

* Multi-threaded and multi-process support for better load balancing and throughput.
* Full bidirectional async support.
* Documentation.
* Unit tests.
